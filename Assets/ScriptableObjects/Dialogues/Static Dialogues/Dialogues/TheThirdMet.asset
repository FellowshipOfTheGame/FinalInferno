    - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 55b0a971506fad04bae8141f62d3bc51, type: 2}
      text: "I wouldn\xB4t worry much about that now, you have all of hell to kill
        you know? And you surely won\u2019t be even able to get in with what I\u2019ve
        saw"

    - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 55b0a971506fad04bae8141f62d3bc51, type: 2}
      text: The plain, yes. The place, no. We are standing right at the border between
        hell and absolute nothing.

        you know?
    - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 55b0a971506fad04bae8141f62d3bc51, type: 2}
      text: Hell itself is like a great walled city where the sinners go for what
        they deserve, and that city has great walls, and even greater gates guarded
        by even greater Cerberuses!

      text: "Cerberuses? The holy books never told anything of these creatures, the
        pagans told of these things\u2026 Wait\u2026 Is this hell\u2026"
    - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 55b0a971506fad04bae8141f62d3bc51, type: 2}
      text: No, you fool! All myth has a base of truth, and not only do Cerberuses
        exist but they are gigantic and there are many of them, each one guarding
        a gate to the inner walls.
    - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 55b0a971506fad04bae8141f62d3bc51, type: 2}

      text: "I say you don\u2019t! There is a way to defeat those things, and I might
        be able to give it to all of you, but there is a little thing I need of you
        guys first."

        make it clear."

      text: One road here leads to the main gates, where the big bad Cerberus is,
        the other way leads to a small ruin.

      text: A group of rogue demons used to live there, preparing their uprising against
        hell itself, which, of course, failed.
    - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 55b0a971506fad04bae8141f62d3bc51, type: 2}
      text: Some runaway demons still live in that area though; the whole place seems
        to emanate an energy that attracts them.
    - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 55b0a971506fad04bae8141f62d3bc51, type: 2}
      text: 'What I want you to do is quite simple: go there; kill as many as you
        wish and bring whatever thing powers the whole place to me.'
