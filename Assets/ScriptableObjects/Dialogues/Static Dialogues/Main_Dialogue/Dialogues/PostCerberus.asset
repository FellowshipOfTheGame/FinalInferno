      text: Oh my, you four really have some power to your punches! This sacrifice
        is sure to satisfy the Lord! But I am no bad dealer, at least not anymore,

        for you if we knew what we are fighting against, I bet the demons of hell
        have a high value for your Lord. Don\u2019t they?"

      text: Agrippa? He was a crazy old fool but he sure was accurate in his descriptions
        of hell. Even though he never had stept foot on it.
