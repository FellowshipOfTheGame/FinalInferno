      text: A group of rogue demons used to live there, preparing their uprising against
        hell itself, which, of course, failed. Some runaway demons still live in that
        area though; the whole place seems to emanate an energy that attracts them.

      text: What I want you to do is quite simple, go there, kill as many as you wish,
        and bring whatever thing powers the whole place to me, that should be enough
        of a sacrifice to please my Lord!
